# Records-management-with-SkipList

This project was made for the University class "Operating Systems".
The task was to implement a structure in the main memory in which we 
could insert, access and modify records that had to do with student progress.

# What I Learned

* Basics of a Linux environment and the relevant programming and software development tools.
